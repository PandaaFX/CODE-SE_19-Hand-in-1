# SE_19 Hand-in 1

This repository contains a simple, clean static website built entirely with HTML and CSS.

The project consists of three main pages:

- **Home (`index.html`)**: The main landing page.
- **Features (`features.html`)**: A breakdown of the product/service features.
- **Pricing (`pricing.html`)**: The pricing plans and tiers.

All styling is custom-written and organized in the `assets/css/` directory. It uses a `global.css` file for shared styles, alongside specific stylesheets for each individual page to keep things modular.
